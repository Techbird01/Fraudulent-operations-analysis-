Key Findings
- Most Targeted Amount per Transaction: The dashboard reveals that fraudulent transactions typically range between $1,000 and $15,000. This range suggests that fraudsters are targeting medium to high-value transactions, potentially aiming to maximize their gains while avoiding detection.
- Most Used Device for Fraud: Desktop devices are the most commonly used for fraudulent activities. This could indicate that fraudsters prefer the flexibility and anonymity that desktop devices offer, or it might simply reflect the widespread use of desktops for online transactions.
- Most Used Payment Method: Debit cards are the preferred payment method for fraudsters. Debit cards might be targeted due to the direct access they provide to funds, making them an attractive option for those seeking to exploit financial information.
- Most Targeted Age Group: Transactions involving individuals aged 1-10 years are the most targeted. This alarming trend suggests that children are being specifically targeted, potentially due to their lack of financial awareness or the fact that their information might be easier to exploit.

Implications and Recommendations
- Enhanced Transaction Monitoring: Given the targeted transaction range, implementing advanced transaction monitoring systems that can detect anomalies within this range could help identify potential fraud.
- Desktop Security Measures: Emphasizing desktop security through measures like two-factor authentication, regular software updates, and robust antivirus protection can help mitigate the risk of desktop-based fraud.
- Debit Card Security: Implementing additional security measures for debit card transactions, such as transaction limits or specific approval requirements for high-value transactions, could reduce the risk of fraud.
- Protecting Vulnerable Age Groups: Given the targeting of children, it's crucial to implement robust security measures for accounts belonging to minors. This might include enhanced parental controls, monitoring, and education on safe online practices.
